# Creating a Video Game In Godot (Untitled TD DevLog 1)

![Untitled TD gameplay](images/td_0.png)

I am making a game! Growing up, it was one of my dreams to make a game. There is something special about having a creative outlet to explore in your downtime.

Before I ever knew about the wonders of **game engines** (such as [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)), I was making games using a Python library called [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news). Pygame is a great choice for learning the basics of writing a game! Whilst it doesn't provide all of the features a **game engine** might, it provides a basic API for rendering visual output onto a canvas. The lack of an underlying *game engine* results in game developers having freedom over how to implement features that may be common within game engines; take physics calculations as an example. If you want a *bullet* to follow the physics of **projectile motion**, you have to implement the equations *yourself*. You also must ensure that the forces and velocities are calculated each iteration of the **game loop**.

With my basic background in **Pygame** from many years ago, this time round, I decided to create a game in **Godot**.
